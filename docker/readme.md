# Docker Compose for MLflow üì¶

Welcome to the **Docker Compose** setup for **MLflow**! This project provides a streamlined way to deploy and manage these powerful tools for time-series data storage and machine learning lifecycle management. Here's how to get started:

## Overview üìù

This Docker Compose configuration sets up:

- **MLflow**: An open-source platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, model packaging, and serving.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Docker installed on your system (version 20.10.0 or later)
- Docker Compose installed (version 1.29.0 or later)
